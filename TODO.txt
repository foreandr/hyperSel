1. change the headers to look like a google bot?

    final_obj = 
    {
        value:28
    }

4. api scraper auto download browser mob

5. SHOULD BE ABLE TO HAVE AN LLM PARSE html

6. maybe have some system that does an appraisal of a site?
    -  does it have apis? does it need browser, proxy, etc

print("OUTPUT IN CSV OR JSON OR WHATEVER")

print("NOTE: this can be a wonderful function that takes in booleans, and the tag, and class/id name, the function can be abstracted out, and the soup")

think about this as a general personalized search tool
    1. - if a person wants videos, it will spin up and get videos
    - iframe local to be able to show videos?

    2. if a person wants cars, it will basically act as youtube for cars, u toggle which sites u want grawled, it gets the data 

    3. on the right hand side, have a big crawled catalogue that people can search through and download and run

be able to save listings, make playlists
    - everything I do on youtube, I should in principle be able to do here

in the code clearly dilineate where the columns are

allow "download data (sizegb)" in the third column next to enabling cralwers or not, csv, json, xml, etc

i need some way that, someone else could write a cralwwer, like an extension, and then I download it locally, and then u can run it, and have it showing
    - use case:
    - i want cars, so I run hypersel, i run with auto and edmunds, turns out I can turn on other cralwers too, great, download and riunh
